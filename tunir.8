Tunir is a simple testing tool. The goal is to have a system which is
simple to setup, and easy to maintain.

.SH WHY ANOTHER CI?
.sp
I have used Jenkins before. I was maintaining one instance in one of my VPS
instance.  The amount of RAM required by Jenkins was too much for my small VM.
I can admit that I am not a great sys\-admin anyway.
.sp
As part of my daily job, I have to test the latest cloud images we build under
Fedora project. While doing so, I figured out that most of it can be automated
if we have a system to create/maintain/terminate cloud instances. Of course I
do not want any actual cloud, it will be a different monster to maintain.
.sp
This is the point where I came up with Tunir. Tunir is a simple testing tool
that will help me run automated tests for the cloud images. I kept the system
generic enough to execute any kind of tests people want.
.sp
The configuration is very minimal with Tunir.
.SH INSTALLATION

.SH USAGE
.sp
Tunir is a mini continuous integration (CI) system which can run a set of commands/tests in a
new cloud VM, or bare metal, or in Vagrant boxes based on the job configurations.
.sp
The current version can be used along with cron to run at predefined times. Tunir prints
the output in the terminal, it also saves each command it ran, and the output in a text
file located at \(aq/var/run/tunir/tunir_results.txt\(aq.
.SS Configuring a new job
.sp
There are two different kinds of job configuration files, the newer one is Multi\-VM config
which can take any qcow2 image and use them to boot up one or more VMs. The other option
is to use a JSON file based configuration which can be used for vm(s), vagrant images, or
bare metal remote system based testing.
.sp
For a Multi\-VM configuration for a job called \fBdefault\fP create \fBdefault.cfg\fP file as
explained below. We will also require another \fBdefault.txt\fP file which will contain the
steps for testing.
.SS jobname.cfg
.sp
New in version 0.14.

.sp
The following example contains a job where we are creating two VMs from the given image
files. The images can be either standard cloud image, or Atomic image. We generate ssh
keys for each run, and use that to login to the box.

The above configuration file is self\-explanatory.
Each of the vm(s) created from the above configuration will get all the other vms\(aq IP
details in the \fI/etc/hosts\fP along with vm name. Means \fIvm1\fP can ping \fIvm2\fP and vice
versa. For each run, Tunir creates a new RSA key pair and pushes the public key to each
vm, and uses the private key to do ssh based authentication.

.SS Debugging test vm(s)
.sp
New in version 0.14.

.sp
This can also be used a quick way to get a few vm(s) up. While using Multi\-VM configuration,
one can pass \fB\-\-debug\fP command line argument, and this will make sure that the vm(s) do not
get destroyed at the end of the tests. It will create a \fIdestroy.sh\fP file, and print the path
at the end of the run. All the vm(s) will be in running condition. You can ssh into them by
using \fIprivate.key\fP file found in the same directory of the \fIdestroy.sh\fP\&.
.sp
When your debugging is done, you can execute the shell script to clean up all the running instances
and any temporary file created by the previous run.

.SS jobname.txt
.sp
This text file contains the bash commands to run in the system, one command per line. In case you are
rebooting the system, you may want to use \fBSLEEP NUMBER_OF_SECONDS\fP command there.
.sp
If a command starts with @@ sign, it means the command is supposed to fail. Generally, we check the return codes
of the commands to find if it failed, or not. For Docker container\-based systems, we track the stderr output.
.sp
We can also have non\-gating tests, means these tests can pass or fail, but the whole job status will depend
on other gating tests. Any command in jobname.txt starting with ## sign will mark the test as non\-gating.

.SS For Multi\-VM configurations
.sp
New in version 0.14.

.sp
In case where we are dealing with multiple VMs using .cfg file in our configuration,
we prefix each line with the vm name (like vm1, vm2, vm3). This marks which command
to run on which vm. The tool first checks the available vm names to these marks in the
\fIjobname.txt\fP file, and it will complain about any extra vm marked in there. If one
does not provide vm name, then it is assumed that the command will execute only on
vm1 (which is the available vm).

In the above example the line 1, and 3 will be executed on the vm1, and line 2 will be

.SS Using Ansible
.sp
New in version 0.14.

.sp
Along with Multi\-VM configuration, we got a new feature of using
\fI\%Ansible\fP to configure the vm(s) we create. To do so,
first, create the required roles, and playbook in a given path. You can write down
the group of hosts with either naming like \fIvm1\fP, \fIvm2\fP, \fIvm3\fP or give them
proper names like \fIkube\-master.example.com\fP\&. For the second case, we also have to
pass these hostnames in each vm definition in the configuration file. We also
provide the path to the directory containing all ansible details with \fIansible_dir\fP
value.
